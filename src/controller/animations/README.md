## How to use

Create a copy of `./src/controller/templates/CanvasTemplate.ts` in this directory by running `yarn create-animation` from the project root. Change the file name to something unique and use PascalCase.

Run `yarn update-animations`. This will update `./src/controller/index.ts` to include your new animation. You will see it in the list of animations on the landing page.
